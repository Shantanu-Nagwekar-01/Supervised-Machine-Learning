# 🏡 California Housing Price Predictor

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict median house prices in California based on features like median income, average rooms, population, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Workflow

- Load California Housing dataset using `fetch_california_housing()`  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize key feature correlations using heatmaps and scatter plots  
- Preprocess data (scaling and splitting)  
- Train a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`  
- Evaluate model using **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  

---

## 📈 Results

- **R² Score:** ~0.60  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** ~0.52  
- Model shows a moderate fit—predicts general trends but may underperform on non-linear patterns.
